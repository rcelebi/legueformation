A Simulation of Mobile Prisoners' Dilemma/Snow Drift Game on Diverse Habitats.
It investigates promotion of cooperative behavior in Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game while players are allowed to move between different gaming environments what we call habitats. The proposed stochastic mobile model constituted by connected habitats in the form of a 2D grid. The players residing in the same habitat are allowed to interact only with their neighbors. The mobile player can move from its habitat to another based on both its obtained payoff and the habitat diversity values that are assigned, randomly.
